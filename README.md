Part One 
Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow: 

• Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year. 
• Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year. 
• Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year. 
• All other years are not leap years. 

Write a function that takes in a year as a string and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.

Part Two 
Create a function that takes in a letter of the alphabet. If the letter is a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the letter is y then your function should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your function should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant. 

Part Three
The length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. Create a function that reads the name of a month as a string and displays the number of days in that month. I should display “28 or 29 days” for February so that leap years are addressed. 

BONUS: 

Refactor part three so it takes in a year as well as month and returns the correct number of days for February, instead of the catch all “28 or 29 days”.
